# Solution: The Humana Project
### HUMANA
If win and will make and fund HUMANA it will be a DAO made on Aragon. HUMANA will be distributed to the funders, founders and builders of The Humana Project. To begin with Humana governs the following blockchain contracts: HUM Generation contracts, mathematical balancing contracts, Death Contracts, spin-up contracts.

### HUM
HUM cannot be bought or sold. It is a token to that wallet forever. It is bound to a death contract. It represents it's holder's digital self.

### DEL
DEL controls the end user's wallet. If they have it in their wallet, they control it. If someone else has it in their wallet, they control it. A tool like Aragon Governance can be used by DEL holders. Each Del gets one vote in Humana, so eventually they will get more votes, unless Humana changes that first. DEL's value, however is based on what is in the end user's wallet.

### MORI
When the death contract is executed, a HUM turns into a MORI, like memento mori. The MORI is then bound to the wallet.

## Death Contract
A death contract is like a digital will. This can be triggered by a death verification service. Traditional financial institutions use tools like the National Technical Information Service https://dmf.ntis.gov/
